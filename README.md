# Deal-bot
This is a bot created with Selenium and python. it searches booking.com and reports back the cheapest deals available for the place , dates and number of travellers the user specifies.

It uses python and selenium to automate this function. The user can run the bot either from their terminal or from an IDE.

[NOTE: THE USER NEEDS TO INSTALL SELENIUM AND WEBDRIVER FOR THIS BOT TO WORK. THE USER ALSO NEEDS TO ADD SELENIUM AND WEBDRIVERS TO THE PATH.

NOTE: THE USER CAN CUSTOMIZE THE BOT WITH THEIR INFORMATION REGARDING THE DESTINATION, THE DATE, AND NUMBER OF PASSENGERS. TO DO THAT GO TO MAIN.PY AND CUSTOMIZE (THE DATE BY DEFAULT IN THE CODE IS OF OCTOBER - NOVEMBER 2022 IF YOU ARE RUNNING THE PROGRAM AFTER THIS, YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE DATES OTHERWISE THE BOT MAY NOT WORK)

IMPORTANT: THERE IS ALSO 2 MAIN.PY FILES. YOU CAN RUN ANY ONE OF THEM. IF ONE OF THEM DOES NOT WORK TRY ANOTHER THE OTHER ONE.]
